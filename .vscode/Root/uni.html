    <p class="p2p3">Making international friends has become easier than ever with sites like MeetUp and Girls Gone International. These groups and many others like them bring together all international people living in a city away from home and will give you a wider spectrum of international friendship outside of student life. You can choose to join events created by other people- such as hiking trips, creative activities, or even pub nights, and you can even create your own! </p>
